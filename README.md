# CAT304 Project - THRIFT N GO
We are developing a project called Thrift 'n Go to overcome the wastage problem by offering a platform that allows local restaurants, grocery stores, and catering services to donate or sell leftover cooked meals or raw food to those in need at a cheaper price. Other than that, users can also sell unwanted items on the platform as well to prevent wastage. It is a web/mobile app created using Vue.js framework that helps users track the food and non-food item available nearby based on their location.
